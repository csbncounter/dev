        April 29 is quickly approaching. Register your Battalion <strong>now</strong> to lock in your spot and to help us plan the greatest possible event. If you are still considering whether you can come, please let us know at <a href='mailo:info@csbncounter.org'>info@csbncounter.org</a>.  That will help us a lot in planning.
      </p>
      <h4>Propose an Activity</h4>
      <p class="video-text-padding">
        One of the great features of the N-Counter experience are the great variety of activities brought by Battalions. Part of your Battalion Unit Registration includes a spot to propose and describe the event you would like to present at N-Counter 2016.  See <a href="/events">Events</a> for suggestions.
      </p>
      <h4>Submit an Accommodation Preference</h4>
      <p class="video-text-padding">
        With all of the activities, little time will be spent in your quarters. Tent camping is the norm, but limited spaces are available in-doors. We want you to have the best experience possible. Mark your accommodation preference on your Battalion Unit Registration. Dorm space is available to your unit for an additional $10 per person, for those who will not be bringing tents for field camping.
