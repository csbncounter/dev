        Battalions from regions far and wide bring an activity, a skill, a challenge, or a competition to share with the others.  Every young man heads into a non-stop adventure of one new experience after the next together with old friends and new.  Think “everything that is awesome about Battalion” in one place for one weekend.

        In the evening, all gather under one roof for a passionate worship ceremony followed by an awe-inspiring outdoor torchlight and bonfire event that leaves no one without personally encountering God.  This year the theme is “Press On” based on Philippians 3:12-16.

          12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 13 Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 14 I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.

          <i>Press on</i>.  You'll see it on our brochures, T-shirts and patch emblems.  Dare we trust God to see this challenge working in our lives?

          Look at what Paul is saying: he presses on toward something, a goal, a mark, a finish. We are pressing on, reaching toward maturity, specifically spiritual maturity.  Yet, none of us is expected to press on alone.  There are always others who are called to press on with us, and we encourage one another, saying, “I am lighting your torch, and we will press on together.”

He is a board member of CSB Ministries and shows a characteristic ability to relate to us in Brigade as he shares time with us throughout our event.  Chuck communicates and leads extraordinarily well in our unified experience of dedication to Christ and the mission of Christian Service Brigade.

        Chuck uniquely combines several years of business experience, 23 years of military service and over 10 years of full-time ministry equipping, training, empowering and releasing a new generation of leaders. He has a passion to see churches return to truly intergenerational communities and develop the clear pathways that keep young adults actively connected to their churches and see them develop into the leaders that will impact every area of our society.
